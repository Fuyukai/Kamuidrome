# Here's my small Complaining About The Modrinth API section.
#
# the ``/search`` API and the ``/project`` API have both fields named arbitrarily differently
# (``project_id`` in ``/search``, ``id`` in ``project`` - what fucking ID could it be in search
# that isn't the project ID!) *and* fields with the same name but DIFFERENT meanings (``versions``
# in ``/search`` is the *game versions*, whereas ``versions`` in ``/project`` refers to *project*
# versions instead, and it has a ``game_versions`` field instead.)
#
# the ratelimit stuff is blatant "this was made by somebody who wrote a Discord wrapper library".
# i'm ignoring it because I don't care about hitting your ratelimits.
#
# search queries are some horrible json array query parameter syntax that is passed directly
# to meilisearch (lol) so if you fuck it up you get an unhelpful error message from either the
# backend (because fake json parsing failed) or meilisearch complaining about indexes. fun fucking
# fact: when i was writing this today (2024-01-13), i trieed using a query over ``game_version``
# and it didn't work even though the docs said it would. then the site went down, and it started
# working again immediately after. what the hell is up with that?
#
# STOP MAKING ME PUT JSON IN QUERY STRINGS. are they fucking allergic to commas? hmm yes today
# i will urlescape ``["1.19.2"]``. what a bunch of wasted work for no reason.
#
# minor nitpick: the API returns the sha-1 hash (what?) and the sha512 hash which sucks because
# i use blake2b hashes.
#
# more will certainly come as i deal more with the API, but I am already annoyed.
